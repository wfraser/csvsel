TODO:

- functions
    - the Function item in queryparse.y is icky, only allowing
        0,1,2,3-ary functions. Should allow n-ary functions.
        - this requires more complex data structures to achieve

- types
    - lots of mixing of num vs long vs integer, dbl vs float vs double
        - clean these up
    - the val.is_foo bools are icky; should be an enum instead

- support for date/time type

- unit tests

- support sorting on more than one column
